# Requirements


## Introduction
 
The aim of this application is to throw light on the basics of Cryptography and Learn & Practice basic Encryption and Decryption through substitution techniques. Many Cyber Security courses expect students to have an understanding of essential concepts underlying Cryptographic system. 
The application covers five substitution techniques: Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Hill Cipher and Polyalphabetic Cipher.
The user can use the application in the following manner:
1.	Learn: Read about the cipher and understand the concept underlying
2.	Practice: Answer the questions for both Encryption and Decryption and check their understanding.

Use this application as a kickstart module to your journey in Cryptography and Network Security


## Research

Cyber security is of absolute importance to today’s world and more people are starting to show interest in this field. While today’s cyber security systems have come a long way and evolved to combat modern problems, it is always beneficial to go back to the beginning and start from the basics. 
Many courses either move to advanced concepts swiftly after briefing the basics or indulge in too much detail which is exhausting for a beginner. 
Features of proposed application:
1.	Concise Information: Every topic will consist of an introduction, the concept of encryption and decryption and the formulae used.
2.	Practice: The user is prompted a set of questions which enables to check their understanding

Target Audience:
1.	Computer Science (or related) Students/Faculties
2.	Cryptography Enthusiasts
3.	Beginners to Cyber Security
